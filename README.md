🔑 Environment Variables

Create a .env.local file in the root directory:

DJANGO_API_URL=https://humhai.in


⚠️ Do not wrap values in quotes
⚠️ Restart the dev server after changing env variables

🚀 Getting Started (Local Development)
1. Install dependencies
npm install

2. Run the development server
npm run dev


App will be available at:

http://localhost:3000

🏗 Build for Production
npm run build
npm start

🌐 Routing Behavior
Route	Type	Description
/	Dynamic	Dashboard with search params
/attendance	Static	Attendance overview
/employee/[id]	Dynamic	Employee profile

Next.js automatically determines static vs dynamic rendering based on data usage.

🧠 Architectural Notes

useSearchParams() is used only in Client Components

Client Components are wrapped in <Suspense> at the Server Component level

All API calls are executed server-side for security and performance

Environment variables are never accessed directly in client code

📦 Deployment

The application is deployed on Vercel using the App Router.

Deployment steps:

Push code to GitHub

Import repository into Vercel

Add environment variables in Vercel dashboard

Deploy

🔒 Security Considerations

Backend API URL is kept server-side

No sensitive keys exposed to the browser

Server Components handle all secure data fetching

📌 Future Enhancements

Pagination and server-side filtering

Role-based access control

Export reports (CSV / PDF)

Attendance analytics charts

Authentication and authorization
